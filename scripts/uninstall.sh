# --------------------------------------------------------- cleanup guidance ----

cleanup_prompt() {
  cat <<'PROMPT'
Clean up the shared-file leftovers from uninstalling hermitd in this project. Detect first, then remove only hermit-attributable content. Act on each item only if it is present, show me a diff before every write, and touch nothing else. If an entry could predate hermit or reflect a deliberate operator choice, flag it and ask instead of deleting it. Examples include a generic Artifact grant, a language key, or a permission entry I may use myself.

Check these item classes:

1. In whichever of CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md contains it, remove the core block from the opening marker:
<!-- hermitd: Session Discipline -->
through the closing marker:
<!-- /hermitd: Session Discipline -->
Include any blank line or standalone separator immediately above the opening marker. If the block predates the closing marker, fall back to the first standalone separator after the opening marker, or end of file. Leave every other plugin's marked block alone.

2. In whichever of .claude/settings.local.json or .claude/settings.json contains them, inspect for hermit-attributable settings. Illustrative examples are permissions.allow or permissions.deny entries referencing hermit scripts or paths; the Artifact grant, which must be flagged rather than auto-deleted; outputStyle when it names hermit-voice; env keys ending in _STATE_DIR; and the boot-written mirror keys language, crossSessionInbound, and isolatePeerMachines. Do not remove sandbox because hermit never writes it. There is no hooks key to clean. Flag any generic permission or setting I may still want.

3. Inspect hermit-rendered or marked files elsewhere. Delete .claude/output-styles/hermit-voice.md if present. Remove only the managed block between the hermitd markers in .worktreeinclude. Review .gitignore hermit lines one at a time because they have no markers, and flag any line I may still want. Remove the # --- hermitd --- block from .env and review the related .env entries in .gitignore and .dockerignore. Offer to delete .claude.local/ (channel tokens) and .claude/cost-log.jsonl (hermit-written). Leave .claude/scheduled_tasks.lock because Claude Code owns it.

Exclude auto-memory, the marketplace registration, docker-entrypoint.hermit-local.sh, and everything under ~/ from this cleanup.
