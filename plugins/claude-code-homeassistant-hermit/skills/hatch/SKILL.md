# Home Assistant Hatch

Set up the Home Assistant layer for this project. Idempotent — safe to re-run; will skip completed steps and offer re-verify only.

## Plan

### 1. Prereq check

Read `.claude-code-hermit/config.json`.

- If the file is missing or `_hermit_versions["claude-code-hermit"]` is absent or less than `1.0.16`:
  - `AskUserQuestion`: "Core hermit is not initialized. Run `/claude-code-hermit:hatch` now?"
  - Yes → invoke `/claude-code-hermit:hatch`, then continue.
  - No → stop and explain what is required.

### 2. Idempotency check

Read `_hermit_versions["claude-code-homeassistant-hermit"]` from `config.json`. Read the `version` field from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

- If versions match → `AskUserQuestion`: "Already set up. Re-verify HA access only (skip setup wizard)?". Yes → skip to §6. No → continue.
- If stale or absent → continue with setup.

### 3. Verify .env

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ha-agent-lab boot status` and inspect the JSON output.

> **Important**: do NOT use `grep`, `cat`, or `echo` on `.env` — the deny-pattern hook blocks any Bash command whose arguments contain the literal string `TOKEN`. Always use the CLI to check credential state.

- `token_configured: true` and `local_url` non-null → proceed.
- **If either is missing**:
  1. Tell the user:
     ```
     .env is missing or incomplete. Please create `.env` at the project root with:

       HOMEASSISTANT_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123   # or your remote URL
       HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN=<your long-lived access token>

     Long-Lived Access Tokens: Home Assistant → Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens.
     ```
  2. `AskUserQuestion`: "When your `.env` is ready, type **done** to continue (or **abort** to stop)."
     - **done** → re-run `boot status` and re-check. If still missing, repeat from step 1. If valid, proceed.
     - **abort** → stop.
  Do not write or modify `.env` — it is the user's responsibility.

Also check locale:

- Read `.claude-code-hermit/OPERATOR.md`. If a `## HA hermit` section has a `- Language:` entry, use it silently — do not re-ask.
- If absent, ask: **Language / locale**: What language should the agent use for HA-facing output? (e.g. `en`, `pt`, `es`) Save it via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ha-agent-lab boot store --language <locale>` (writes to OPERATOR.md under `## HA hermit`).

Do not collect or store the token — it stays in `.env` only.

### 4. Python runtime deps + CLI check

Run `python3 -c "import yaml, dotenv"` (or `.venv/bin/python -c "import yaml, dotenv"` if `.venv/` exists).

- **If it passes** → skip to the CLI status check below.
- **If it fails**:
  1. Probe `python3 -m venv --help`. If that fails, stop and tell the user: `apt install python3-venv` (or OS equivalent), then re-run hatch.
  2. `AskUserQuestion`: "Install Python deps into a project-local `.venv`? Recommended — isolates from system Python and works on PEP 668 hosts." Options: `venv` (default) / `system` / `skip`.
     - **`venv`**: run `python3 -m venv ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.venv` then `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.venv/bin/pip install PyYAML python-dotenv`. Re-probe — if still failing, stop with a diagnostic.
     - **`system`**: run `pip install --user PyYAML python-dotenv`. If it errors with `externally-managed-environment` (PEP 668), offer to fall back to `venv` automatically.
     - **`skip`**: note that §6 will probe again and will fail if deps are absent; continue anyway.
  3. **Do not exit or ask the user to re-run the skill** — continue to the CLI status check in-flight.

CLI check: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ha-agent-lab boot status` (read-only, no `--probe`) to confirm the launcher and Python package resolve correctly.

### 5. Home Assistant MCP Server setup

**Step A — Enable the integration in Home Assistant**

Tell the user: go to Home Assistant → Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search "Model Context Protocol Server". Enable it. This exposes the MCP endpoint at `<your HA URL>/api/mcp`.

Reference: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/

**Step B — Write `.mcp.json`**

Read the HA URL from the `boot status` JSON (`active_url` field, already fetched in §3). Read the token from `.env` using:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ha-agent-lab boot status
```

For the token value, use the **Read** tool on `.env` (not Bash — the deny-pattern hook blocks any Bash argument containing the literal string `TOKEN`, including via `python -c`). Parse the `HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN=...` line in-memory and use the value directly when writing `.mcp.json`. Do not echo the token to the conversation or log it.

Check the project root for `.mcp.json`:
- If absent → write it with literal values substituted.
- If present → read it and check the `homeassistant` entry:
  - If absent → merge it in with literal values.
  - If present **and** the `url` or `Authorization` value contains `${` (old placeholder format) → rewrite that entry with literal values and tell the user the stale entry was replaced.
  - If present and already contains literal values → skip.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homeassistant": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "<HOMEASSISTANT_URL>/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<HOMEASSISTANT_URL>` with the `active_url` from `boot status` (resolves to `HOMEASSISTANT_URL`, or `HOMEASSISTANT_LOCAL_URL` for existing installs) and `<HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN>` with the literal values read above.

The name `homeassistant` is required — skills and the safety hook match on `mcp__homeassistant__*` tool IDs.

> **Note**: `.mcp.json` now contains a live bearer token. Claude Code reads MCP env vars from the process environment, **not** from `.env`, so literal values are required here.

After writing `.mcp.json`, check the project's `.gitignore`:
- If `.mcp.json` is absent from it → append `.mcp.json` on a new line.
- If already present → skip.

**Step C — Activate and verify**

Tell the user: **restart Claude Code** in this project directory. On first use, Claude Code will prompt you to trust the `homeassistant` server — approve it. Then run `/mcp` to confirm `homeassistant` appears as connected. The next `ha-boot` will verify live HA connectivity.

### 6. Verify Python CLI (full probe)

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/ha-agent-lab boot status --probe` and present the result. If it fails:

- Missing deps → repeat the §4 venv install steps inline (create `.venv`, pip install) without exiting or re-invoking hatch.
- Connection refused → check `HOMEASSISTANT_LOCAL_URL` in `.env`.
- Auth error → check `HOMEASSISTANT_TOKEN`.

### 7. Append to CLAUDE.md

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/state-templates/CLAUDE-APPEND.md`.

Check CLAUDE.md for the marker comment `<!-- claude-code-homeassistant-hermit: Home Assistant Workflow -->`:

- Absent → append the full CLAUDE-APPEND.md content.
- Present and version matches current plugin version → skip.
- Present and version is stale → replace the block between the opening and closing markers with the updated content.

### 7.5 Safety mode

Read `ha_safety_mode` from `.claude-code-hermit/config.json`.

- **If the key is already set**: `AskUserQuestion`: "Current safety mode is `<value>`. Change it?" Yes → re-prompt. No → skip this step.
- **If absent**: ask the operator which safety mode to use for sensitive domains (`lock`, `alarm_control_panel`, security-related `cover`/`button`/`switch`):
  - `strict` (recommended) — always block autonomous actuation; work goes through a proposal instead.
  - `ask` — operator is prompted before any actuation of a sensitive entity. Build/validate normally; both YAML apply and direct MCP calls require an explicit operator confirmation before execution.

Write the chosen value to `config.json` as `ha_safety_mode`. Default to `strict` if the operator skips or is unsure.

### 8. Stamp version and register routines

Write `_hermit_versions["claude-code-homeassistant-hermit"]` into `.claude-code-hermit/config.json` with the current plugin version.

**Compiled templates**: Copy `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/state-templates/compiled/acknowledged-violations.md` to `.claude-code-hermit/compiled/acknowledged-violations.md` if that file does not already exist. Set `created` in the frontmatter to today's ISO date. This gives the operator a ready-to-use suppression list for the safety audit.

**Boot skill registration**: Read `config.boot_skill` from `config.json`.

The skill name format is `/<plugin-id>:<skill-id>`. Parse the plugin-id as the text between `/` and `:`.

- If `null` or absent → set it to `/claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-boot`.
- If the value starts with `/claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:` → no-op (report "already set").
- Otherwise (another plugin's namespace) → leave it unchanged and warn: "boot_skill is already set to `<value>` from another plugin — skipping to avoid conflict. Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-settings boot-skill` to update it manually."

**HA routine registration**: `config.routines` is an array of objects with `{id, schedule, skill, enabled, run_during_waiting}`. For each HA routine below, check whether an entry with that `id` already exists in the array. If it does, skip. If not, prompt and merge it in.

1. **Context refresh** — "Add daily HA context-refresh routine (08:30 every day)? Keeps entity snapshots fresh automatically."
   ```json
   {"id": "daily-ha-context", "schedule": "30 8 * * *", "skill": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-refresh-context", "enabled": true, "run_during_waiting": false}
   ```

2. **Morning brief** — "Add morning house brief routine (09:00 every day)? Delivers a live house summary at start of day. Disabled by default — enable after setup is complete."
   ```json
   {"id": "morning-brief", "schedule": "0 9 * * *", "skill": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-morning-brief", "enabled": false, "run_during_waiting": false}
   ```

After adding any new entries, remind the operator: "Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-routines load` to activate routines in the current session."

**Scheduled checks registration**: `config.scheduled_checks` is an array of periodic skill entries that the `scheduled-checks` routine (via `reflect-scheduled-checks`) invokes on a cadence and funnels through the proposal pipeline. For each entry below, check whether an existing record has the same `id`. If not, append it — no prompt needed, all three are safe read-only analyses.

```json
{"id": "ha-patterns",            "plugin": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit", "skill": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-analyze-patterns",        "enabled": true, "trigger": "interval", "interval_days": 7}
{"id": "ha-safety-audit",        "plugin": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit", "skill": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-safety-audit",           "enabled": true, "trigger": "interval", "interval_days": 7}
{"id": "ha-integration-health",  "plugin": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit", "skill": "claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-integration-health",    "enabled": true, "trigger": "interval", "interval_days": 1}
```

These replace any need for CronCreate routines around analysis/observability — the `scheduled-checks` routine picks up whichever check is due, runs it, and any findings surface as proposals automatically.

### 9. Final report

Summarize:

```
hatch complete
  ✓  .env verified (user-managed)
  ✓  Python deps: <venv at .venv/ | system python> → OK / FAILED
  ✓  Python CLI: bin/ha-agent-lab boot status --probe → OK / FAILED
  ✓  .mcp.json: homeassistant entry written / already present
  ✓  CLAUDE.md updated
  ✓  config.json stamped v<version>
  ✓  boot_skill: /claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-boot (set | already set | operator override preserved)
  ✓  Routines registered: daily-ha-context, morning-brief (disabled by default)
  ✓  Scheduled checks registered: ha-patterns, ha-safety-audit, ha-integration-health

Manual steps remaining:
  - Enable 'Model Context Protocol Server' integration in Home Assistant (if not done)
    Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → search "MCP"
  - Restart Claude Code and approve the 'homeassistant' server on first use
  - Run /mcp to confirm 'homeassistant' is connected

Go always-on (recommended):
  - Docker:     /claude-code-hermit:docker-setup
      Builds the container and walks you through channel pairing in one go.
  - Bare tmux:  .claude-code-hermit/bin/hermit-start
      For channels (Discord/Telegram) with tmux, run
      /claude-code-hermit:channel-setup first.

Prefer to test interactively first?
  1. /claude-code-homeassistant-hermit:ha-boot
       — single entry point: starts the hermit session, probes HA,
         and auto-refreshes the context snapshot if stale/missing.
  2. /claude-code-hermit:hermit-routines load
       — activates scheduled routines in the current Claude session.

The always-on runtime does both of these automatically — the interactive
steps are only for a test drive before handing over to the runtime.
```

## Docker network requirements

Read by `/claude-code-hermit:docker-security` when the operator enables LAN containment + DNS policy. Each entry is surfaced as a per-entry confirmation prompt; nothing here is auto-applied.

### Domains (DNS allowlist)

- nabu.casa
- home-assistant.io
- READ_FROM_ENV:HOMEASSISTANT_URL

### LAN allowlist suggestions

- ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_HA_IP

The `nabu.casa` entry covers Nabu Casa Cloud (`<id>.ui.nabu.casa`) since dnsmasq's `server=/nabu.casa/...` pattern matches subdomains. `home-assistant.io` covers integration docs (`www.home-assistant.io`) and the developer API reference (`developers.home-assistant.io`) that skills consult when verifying REST/WebSocket endpoints. `READ_FROM_ENV:HOMEASSISTANT_URL` resolves to the hostname of the operator's configured HA instance — covers custom remote domains (e.g. `ha.mydomain.com`) that are not under `nabu.casa`. Operators on a self-hosted local HA instance should accept `ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_HA_IP` and provide the LAN IP of their HA box. mDNS / `homeassistant.local` does not work through dnsmasq — use the IP directly.
