description: Opt-in advanced Docker security hardening beyond the v1.0.26 baseline — LAN containment with DNS policy, resource bounds with kernel-hygiene sysctls, and a boot-time plugin install audit log. Applied as a reversible docker-compose overlay (does not touch the base compose file) and verified against the live container. Run after /docker-setup; requires bridge networking.
---

# Docker Security

Advanced hardening for already-deployed hermit containers. Each toggle is opt-in, presented with honest cost/benefit framing, and applied as a `docker-compose.security.yml` overlay that the `hermit-docker` wrapper auto-detects. Reversal: re-run and answer No to every prompt, or delete `docker-compose.security.yml` directly.

**Tone:** Honest about tradeoffs. Tell operators what each toggle does AND does not protect. Do not oversell.

**Important:** Run all checks and commands sequentially — do not use parallel tool calls.

Templates live in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../state-templates/docker/security/`.

## Trust model framing (read to operator at the start of step 2)

> Installing a plugin runs that plugin's hooks and skills with the same authority as hermit. The container hardening here reduces what a *compromised* plugin can do to the host kernel and your local network — it does not vet the plugin's intent, sandbox its file access within the project, or prevent it from acting on your behalf via the agent. A malicious or careless plugin still runs as you.
>
> **Honest limitation:** DNS policy below blocks domain-based exfil/C2 but cannot stop direct-IP egress to a hardcoded public address. A future release may add nftset-driven IP allowlisting.

## Plan

### 0. Refuse to run inside the hermit container

This skill is host-only — it writes a `docker-compose.security.yml` overlay on the host and recreates the container with stronger isolation.

Run: `[ -f /.dockerenv ] || [ -f /run/.containerenv ] && echo container || echo host`

If the output is `container`, **stop immediately** — do not proceed to step 1. Print:

> This skill writes a `docker-compose.security.yml` overlay on the host and recreates the container with stronger isolation. Run it from your host shell in the project root. To inspect the live security posture *inside* the running container, run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-doctor` — it includes a `docker-security` check.

### 1. Prerequisites

1. Read `.claude-code-hermit/config.json`. If missing: "Run `/claude-code-hermit:hatch` first." Stop.
2. Verify `docker-compose.hermit.yml` exists at the project root. If missing: "Run `/claude-code-hermit:docker-setup` first." Stop.
3. **Docker daemon check**: run `timeout 10s docker info >/dev/null 2>&1`. If it fails or times out: tell the operator "Docker daemon is not reachable or timed out. Start Docker before re-running `/docker-security`." Stop.
4. Read `docker.network_mode` from config (default: `"bridge"`). If `"host"`, set `HOST_NETWORK_MODE=true` and surface to operator: "Detected `network_mode: host` in your config. The LAN containment toggle (Prompt 1) will be skipped — it would replace host mode and break your HA / host-bound service access. Resource bounds (Prompt 2) will not apply network sysctls in host mode either; Docker rejects them and the container would fail to start."
5. **Detect hermit ports**: run `timeout 10s docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml config --format json 2>/dev/null` and parse `.services.hermit.ports`. Store as in-memory `detected_hermit_ports` (array of long-form Compose port objects: `{target, published, host_ip, protocol, mode}`). If the command fails or returns no JSON, fall back to `grep -n '^\s*ports:' docker-compose.hermit.yml` and set `detected_hermit_ports_unparsed=true` if found. Either way, a non-empty result means ports are present.
6. Check whether the container is currently running: `docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml ps --status running --format '{{.Service}}' 2>/dev/null | grep -x hermit`. If absent: tell the operator "Container is not running. The wizard will still write the overlay; you'll see the live verification only after starting the container with `hermit-docker up`."
7. Read current `docker.security.*` from config.json. Also read `sandbox.enabled` from the target settings file (same `hatch_target` routing as hatch/docker-setup: `hatch_target == "local"` → `.claude/settings.local.json`; else → `.claude/settings.json`) — display only, hermit does not configure this key. Print a "current posture" summary. Example:

   ```
   Current security posture:
     LAN containment: off
     Resource bounds: off
     Audit log: off

   Baseline (always on, from v1.0.26):
     cap_drop: ALL, no-new-privileges, pids_limit: 2048

   Sandbox (bash tool isolation, operator-managed via /sandbox):
     enabled: true  (or: false / not configured)
   ```

### 2. Trust model framing

Print the trust-model paragraph from the top of this file (the blockquote). Then continue.

### 3. Prompt 1 — LAN containment + DNS policy

If `HOST_NETWORK_MODE` is true, **do not present this prompt**. Tell the operator: "Skipping LAN containment — incompatible with `network_mode: host`. Run `/claude-code-hermit:docker-setup` to switch to bridge mode if you want this hardening." Continue to step 4.

Otherwise, ask with `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"LAN containment"`):

```
question: "Add LAN containment with DNS policy? (firewall sidecar + DNS allowlist)"
options:
  - label: "Yes — recommended (LAN block + DNS log-only)"
    description: "Blocks RFC1918 + cloud metadata. DNS in log-only mode: allows everything, logs blocked queries for tuning."
  - label: "Yes — strict (LAN block + DNS enforce)"
    description: "Same LAN block. DNS returns NXDOMAIN for any domain not on the allowlist."
  - label: "No"
    description: "Skip this toggle."
```

Map: `"Yes — recommended"` → `dns_mode: "log-only"`. `"Yes — strict"` → `dns_mode: "enforce"`. `"No"` → skip to step 4.

#### 3-pre. Port conflict handling (only if a "Yes" option was selected above)

If the operator selected a "Yes" option AND `detected_hermit_ports` is non-empty (or `detected_hermit_ports_unparsed=true`), surface a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Port publishing"`) immediately:

```
Your docker-compose.hermit.yml publishes ports on the hermit service:
  - "3000:3000"        ← list each port if parsed, or "(port block detected)" if unparsed
  ...

LAN containment requires hermit to share hermit-netguard's network namespace.
Docker forbids `ports:` on a container that joins another container's netns —
only netguard (the netns owner) can publish ports.
```

Options:
- `"Move ports to netguard (recommended)"` — render the same `ports:` block on `hermit-netguard` in the overlay. Persist to `docker.security.network.publish_ports`. After overlay is written (step 6), show a diff and prompt the operator to delete the `ports:` block from `docker-compose.hermit.yml` themselves — the wizard does not modify the base file.
- `"Skip LAN containment (keep ports on hermit)"` — clear the LAN containment selection (treat as if operator answered No above). Set `lan_containment_skipped_due_to_ports=true`. Continue to step 4.
- `"Cancel"` — print "Re-run /docker-security after deciding how to handle your port publishing. See docs/docker-security.md for guidance." Exit. Write nothing.

**If operator chose "Skip LAN containment"**: proceed to step 4 without any LAN containment config. Step 9 final-report notes: "LAN containment skipped — docker-compose.hermit.yml has a `ports:` block on hermit that is incompatible with `network_mode: service:hermit-netguard`."

#### 3a. Fleet-aware domain seeding

Scan installed fleet plugins. From the host:

```bash
bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resolve-siblings.ts "$(pwd)" --role siblings
```

It emits a JSON array of the project-or-local + enabled hermit siblings (each carrying `plugin`, `installPath`), already excluding user-scope, disabled, cross-project, and `claude-code-hermit` itself.

For each entry:

1. Locate the plugin's installed root using the `installPath` field from the JSON.
2. Read `<plugin>/skills/hatch/SKILL.md` and look for a `## Docker network requirements` heading. Also check `<plugin>/DOCKER.md`. Stop at the next `##` heading.
3. Within that section, parse:
   - `### Domains (DNS allowlist)` — bullet entries are domain names. Validate against `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9.-]+$`. Reject failing entries with a warning.
   - `### LAN allowlist suggestions` — bullet entries are either IPv4 CIDRs (validate with regex) OR the special token `ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_HA_IP` (or other `ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_*_IP` patterns). Reject failing CIDRs.
4. Track provenance: each entry remembers which plugin contributed it.

If the deduped fleet list is non-empty, present plain text first:

```
Fleet plugins request these network exceptions:
  api.strava.com           — claude-code-fitness-hermit (DNS)
  www.strava.com           — claude-code-fitness-hermit (DNS)
  ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_HA_IP   — claude-code-homeassistant-hermit (LAN, will prompt for IP)
```

Then ask once with `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Fleet network entries"`):

- `"Include all"` (Recommended)
- `"Pick each"`
- `"Skip all"`

On `"Pick each"`: loop through each entry with a 2-option `AskUserQuestion` (`"Include"` / `"Skip"`).

For every confirmed `ASK_OPERATOR_FOR_HA_IP` (or similar): immediately follow up with `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"<plugin> IP"`) — Other field accepting an IPv4 address or CIDR. Validate. Re-prompt on invalid. Replace the token with the typed value.

Confirmed entries are added to in-memory `fleet_lan_allowlist` and `fleet_domains` for step 6.

If the fleet list is empty: skip silently.

#### 3b. Extra LAN carve-outs

`AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Extra LAN carve-outs"`):

- `"None"`
- `"Add IPs/ranges"` (Other field, comma-separated, IPv4 CIDR validated; re-prompt on invalid)

Persist to `lan_allowlist` (combined with `fleet_lan_allowlist`).

#### 3c. Extra domains

`AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Extra domains"`):

- `"None (use defaults + fleet)"`
- `"Add domains"` (Other field, comma-separated, domain regex validated; re-prompt on invalid)

Persist to `additional_domains` (combined with `fleet_domains`).

#### 3d. Persist Prompt 1 selections

```json
docker.security.network = {
  "enabled": true,
  "dns_mode": "log-only" | "enforce",
  "lan_allowlist": ["192.168.1.50", ...],
  "additional_domains": ["api.strava.com", ...]
}
```

### 4. Prompt 2 — Resource bounds + kernel hygiene

`AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Resource bounds"`):

```
question: "Set memory and CPU caps + network kernel hardening sysctls?"
options:
  - label: "Yes — defaults (mem 4g, cpus 2.0, sysctl bundle)"
    description: "Caps a runaway agent's resource cost; sysctls disable ICMP redirect / source-routing tricks."
  - label: "Yes — custom mem/cpu"
    description: "Pick your own memory and CPU limits."
  - label: "No"
    description: "Skip this toggle."
```

On `"Yes — custom mem/cpu"`: follow up with `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Custom limits"`) — Other field accepting two values, comma-separated. Validate `mem` against `^[0-9]+(g|m)?$`, `cpus` against `^[0-9.]+$`. Re-prompt on invalid.

**Sysctl placement note**:
- If `HOST_NETWORK_MODE` is true: silently set `sysctls_enabled = false` regardless of choice and tell the operator: "Network sysctls cannot be applied with `network_mode: host` — Docker rejects them. Resource bounds (mem/cpus) will still apply if you said Yes."
- Otherwise: `sysctls_enabled = true`.

Persist:

```json
docker.security.resources = {
  "enabled": true,
  "mem_limit": "4g",
  "memswap_limit": "4g",
  "cpus": 2.0,
  "sysctls_enabled": true|false
}
```

### 5. Prompt 3 — Plugin install audit log

`AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Audit log"`):

```
question: "Record every boot-time plugin install to a JSONL audit log?"
options:
  - label: "Yes — recommended"
    description: "Appends one JSONL line per `claude plugin install` performed by the entrypoint to .claude-code-hermit/state/plugin-installs.jsonl. Honest scope: post-boot installs run via tmux are not captured. The log is empty until something actually installs — on subsequent boots when the marketplace + plugin set is unchanged, no install fires and no entry is written. That's normal, not a failure."
  - label: "No"
    description: "Skip this toggle."
```

Persist `docker.security.audit.plugin_installs` accordingly.

### 6. Render overlay

**Before rendering — preserve `publish_ports` across reruns:**
Read `docker.security.network.publish_ports` from the existing config.json (if present). Keep this as `persisted_publish_ports`. In the current wizard run:
- If the operator chose "Move ports to netguard": replace `persisted_publish_ports` with the newly detected ports from step 5 (prerequisites).
- If no base ports were detected AND the operator did not visit the port-conflict flow: keep `persisted_publish_ports` unchanged (the operator already deleted the base block; do not lose the netguard mapping).
- If the operator chose "Skip LAN containment (keep ports on hermit)": set `persisted_publish_ports = []` (LAN containment is off; ports stay on hermit in the base file).

**All-off branch — warn before deletion if `publish_ports` was set:**
Otherwise (all toggles off): before deleting the overlay, check if `persisted_publish_ports` is non-empty. If so, surface:

```
Heads up: turning all toggles off will remove the overlay, including these
ports that hermit-netguard currently publishes:
  - "3000:3000"
  ...

If you previously deleted the `ports:` block from docker-compose.hermit.yml,
you'll need to re-add it there before bringing the container back up — the
overlay won't be there to publish them.
```

Then `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Confirm all-off"`):
- `"Yes — proceed (I'll restore base ports if needed)"`
- `"No — cancel"`

On Yes: continue to overlay deletion, clear `docker.security.*`, tell the operator "All toggles off — overlay removed and config cleared." Skip to step 9.
On No: exit wizard, write nothing.

If `persisted_publish_ports` is empty: proceed directly to deletion without the prompt.

**Subnet auto-detection (only if LAN containment is enabled):**

Run `pick-subnet` — it enumerates occupied Docker subnets, excludes this project's own `hermit-net`, integer-range-checks overlap, walks the 8 fixed /24 candidates, and always exits 0 (probe pattern):

```bash
bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/render-security-overlay.ts pick-subnet <PROJECT_ROOT>
```

It prints `{ "chosen": { "subnet", "gateway", "netguardIp" } | null, "allCandidatesCollide": bool, "occupied": [...] }`.

- If `chosen` is non-null, use it.
- If `allCandidatesCollide` is true, `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Custom subnet"`) with an Other field for an IPv4 /24 CIDR. Validate each answer with one cheap re-run:
  ```bash
  bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/render-security-overlay.ts pick-subnet <PROJECT_ROOT> --candidate <cidr>
  ```
  `chosen: null` means still colliding or not a /24 — re-prompt. `chosen` set means accepted.

Persist the chosen values to `docker.security.network` (`subnet`, `gateway`, `netguard_ip` from `chosen`), alongside `enabled`, `dns_mode`, `lan_allowlist`, `additional_domains`, `publish_ports`. If LAN containment is not enabled, omit `subnet`, `gateway`, `netguard_ip`.

If at least one toggle is enabled, render the overlay. Otherwise (all-off): handled in the all-off branch above.

#### 6a. dnsmasq UID is hardcoded

Render `100` directly into `nftables.conf` as the dnsmasq UID — no probe step. Rationale and recovery path if Alpine ever changes it: see [docs/docker-security.md#design-rationale](https://github.com/gtapps/claude-code-hermit/blob/main/plugins/claude-code-hermit/docs/docker-security.md#design-rationale).

After the netguard files are rendered (step 6c), the wizard runs an explicit `--no-cache` build of `hermit-netguard` to prevent stale Docker cache artifacts from surviving a hermit upgrade. Do not rely on `hermit-docker up` to trigger a rebuild.

#### 6b. Render the overlay + nftables + dnsmasq

`render-security-overlay.ts render` derives every `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` (networks block, netguard service with cap_add/healthcheck, `DNS_LOG_ONLY` from `dns_mode`, per-toggle hermit blocks, sysctls placement, ports, LAN rules at the chain-body indent, `DNSMASQ_UID=100`, `server=` domain lines) and fails loud (exit 1, nothing written) if any survives. It writes `docker-compose.security.yml` to the project root, and — only when LAN containment is on — `nftables.conf` + `dnsmasq.allowlist` into `.claude-code-hermit/docker/`. Pipe the resolved selections:

```bash
bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/render-security-overlay.ts render <PROJECT_ROOT> <<'HERMIT_SEC_JSON'
{
  "network": { "subnet": "...", "gateway": "...", "netguardIp": "..." },
  "toggles": {
    "lan":       { "enabled": true, "dnsMode": "log-only" | "enforce" },
    "resources": { "enabled": true, "memLimit": "4g", "memswapLimit": "4g", "cpus": 2.0, "sysctlsEnabled": true },
    "audit":     { "enabled": true }
  },
  "publishPorts": [ { "target": 3000, "published": "3000", "protocol": "tcp", "host_ip": "0.0.0.0", "mode": "ingress" } ],
  "lanAllowlist": [...],
  "fleetDomains": [...],
  "additionalDomains": [...]
}
HERMIT_SEC_JSON
```

Notes:
- `network` is required only when `toggles.lan.enabled`. The script places sysctls on netguard when LAN is on, on hermit when LAN is off (Prompt 2 only). `host_ip: "0.0.0.0"` and `mode: "ingress"` (Compose defaults) are omitted from rendered port entries.
- If base ports were detected via the grep fallback (`detected_hermit_ports_unparsed=true`) with no parsed shape, pass `publishPorts: []` and tell the operator: "Could not parse port shapes from the compose config — manually add your `ports:` block to `hermit-netguard` in the rendered overlay and delete it from the base file."
- The script prints `{ "written": [...] }`.

#### 6c. Copy the netguard Dockerfile + entrypoint (only if Prompt 1 enabled)

`render` (6b) already wrote `nftables.conf` + `dnsmasq.allowlist`. Copy the two static netguard files from `state-templates/docker/security/` into `.claude-code-hermit/docker/`:

- `Dockerfile.hermit-netguard.template` → `Dockerfile.hermit-netguard`
- `netguard-entrypoint.sh.template` → `netguard-entrypoint.sh` (chmod +x)

After both are copied, force a fresh netguard image build:

```bash
timeout 180s docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml -f docker-compose.security.yml build --no-cache hermit-netguard
```

If the build exits non-zero, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml -f docker-compose.security.yml logs hermit-netguard --tail=30`, surface the output, and suggest a targeted fix:
- **`apk add` fails** → DNS not reachable at build time; check host network and Docker DNS config (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`)
- **Syntax error in nftables.conf or dnsmasq.allowlist** → read the error line; it usually names the file and line number
- **Port already in use** → a published port in the overlay conflicts; `ss -tlnp | grep <port>` finds the owner
Then stop. Do not proceed to step 6d.

#### 6d. Show diff + confirm

Print a one-screen summary of files written (paths + line counts). Ask `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Apply"`) — `"Yes — restart container now"` / `"No — I'll restart manually later"`.

On `"No — I'll restart manually later"`: skip to step 9 with the note "Overlay written. Run `hermit-docker down` then `hermit-docker up` when ready to apply. Re-run `/docker-security` at any time to verify."

### 7. Restart + smoke test

**Hard gate — re-check base ports before starting:**
Before running `hermit-docker up`, re-run the step 5 port detection: `timeout 10s docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml config --format json 2>/dev/null | bun -e 'const d=JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync(0,"utf8")); console.log((((d.services ?? {}).hermit ?? {}).ports ?? []).length)'`. If the result is non-zero (or the command output from the grep fallback is non-empty) AND `docker.security.network.enabled === true` (LAN containment is on):

Ask with `AskUserQuestion` (header: `"Ports conflict"`):
- `"Auto-fix — I'll remove the \`ports:\` block (backup first)"` (Recommended)
- `"I'll edit it myself — pause here"`

**On "Auto-fix":** Back up the base compose file first: `cp docker-compose.hermit.yml docker-compose.hermit.yml.bak`. Then read `docker-compose.hermit.yml`, locate the `ports:` key under the `hermit:` service, and remove it and all its child lines (keep every other key). Write the file back. Print: "Removed `ports:` block from docker-compose.hermit.yml (backup: docker-compose.hermit.yml.bak). Ports are now published by hermit-netguard via the overlay." Continue to the restart sequence below ("If operator chose to restart now...").

**On "I'll edit it myself":** Print:
```
Cannot start container — docker-compose.hermit.yml still publishes ports on hermit.
Those ports are now published by hermit-netguard via the overlay.
Delete the `ports:` block from docker-compose.hermit.yml, then run:
  .claude-code-hermit/bin/hermit-docker up
```
Stop here. Tell the operator: "Overlay and config have been written — just delete the base `ports:` block first, then run `.claude-code-hermit/bin/hermit-docker up`."

If operator chose to restart now AND container was running before this skill (and the hard gate passed):

1. Run `.claude-code-hermit/bin/hermit-docker down`.
2. Run `.claude-code-hermit/bin/hermit-docker up` (the wrapper now picks up the overlay automatically). The first up will trigger `docker compose build hermit-netguard` if Prompt 1 was enabled — wait for completion (can be 30-60s on first build).
3. Poll `docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml -f docker-compose.security.yml ps --status running --format '{{.Service}}'` every 2s for up to 30s; expect `hermit` (and `hermit-netguard` if Prompt 1 enabled). If either is missing after 30s: run `docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml -f docker-compose.security.yml logs <missing-service> --tail=30` (substitute `hermit` or `hermit-netguard` per the missing service; omit the service name if both are down), surface output, and suggest:
   - **hermit-netguard won't start** → nftables or dnsmasq config error; read the log for the line number
   - **hermit won't start** → check if the base `ports:` conflict was fully resolved (re-run the hard gate port check above)
   - **Both down** → Docker daemon issue; `docker info` to confirm daemon is healthy
   Then stop.
### 8. Verify

Stream the static verification script into the live container. It is placeholder-free (hardcoded probe values) and uses only tools the hermit base image ships — `bun`, `jq`, `curl`, glibc `getent` (no `python3`, `nc`, or `nslookup`):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hermit.yml -f docker-compose.security.yml \
  exec -T hermit sh -s < "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/state-templates/docker/security/verify-security.sh"
```

Surface the output to the operator. Suggest: "Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-doctor` to also verify the docker-security check shows green."

### 9. Final report

Print a brief summary:

```
docker-security applied — current posture:
  LAN containment:   on  (DNS log-only)  | LAN carve-outs: 192.168.1.50
  Resource bounds:   on  (mem 4g, cpus 2.0)
  Audit log:         on

Reverse: re-run /docker-security and answer No to every prompt, OR
         delete docker-compose.security.yml and re-run hermit-docker up.

Tune DNS allowlist: edit .claude-code-hermit/docker/dnsmasq.allowlist,
         then `hermit-docker down && hermit-docker up`
         (restart hermit-netguard alone leaves hermit with stale resolver state).
```
