# Reflect — Evaluation Reference

This file is the instruction spec for the isolated-context subagent dispatched by SKILL.md step 6.
The subagent reads only files (no inherited session context); writes and notifications are handled by the
calling main session after it receives the subagent's structured JSON return value. Where an instruction
below says "update frontmatter", "append metrics", "write SHELL.md finding", or "note in Findings",
populate the corresponding field in the return JSON instead — the main session applies those actions.

## Inputs (read fresh — do not reuse cached values)

The dispatch prompt's first line is `Anchor: root=<absolute hermit root> memory_dir=<absolute auto-memory dir>`.
Every `.claude-code-hermit/…` path below is relative to that `root` — read and glob it as
`<root>/…`, and pass `<root>` where a command below spells `.claude-code-hermit`. Your working
directory is inherited from the caller and may sit anywhere, so a relative path reads an empty tree
without erroring. `memory_dir` is the auto-memory directory this file calls `memory-dir`.

- `.claude-code-hermit/state/reflection-state.json` — for `last_resolution_check`, `last_sparse_nudge`
- `.claude-code-hermit/proposals/PROP-*.md` — for accepted proposals (Resolution Check)
- `.claude-code-hermit/sessions/S-*-REPORT.md` — 3 most recent (frontmatter first; open a full body only per the Step 1 rule below)
- routine fires, failures and cost — via `routines.ts health` in Step 2, never by reading
  `routine-metrics.jsonl` or `cost-log.jsonl` directly
- `MEMORY.md` — operator's auto-memory index (procedure detection)

The calling skill passes `phases_json` (the precheck output object listing which phases are due) and
`last_resolution_check` (the cursor from reflection-state.json) in the dispatch prompt. Read them from
the prompt; do not re-read reflection-state.json for the cursor (the main session already read it).
It also passes `plugin_root` (the resolved absolute plugin path) — substitute it for `<plugin_root>`
below. Do not use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` token: it is not substituted in this file's content and
is empty as a Bash variable.

## Step 1 — Resolution Check

Run this step only if `resolution_check` is listed in `phases_json`.

**a.** Read all proposals with `status: accepted` from `.claude-code-hermit/proposals/PROP-*.md`.
   Sort by `accepted_date` ascending. Resume from the proposal after `last_resolution_check` (the cursor
   passed in the dispatch prompt), wrapping around. Take up to 5.

**b.** If the accepted list is empty, skip to the return value (emit `resolution_actions: []`).

**c.** For each proposal: read `title`, `success_signal`, `accepted_in_session`, `accepted_date`,
   `tags`, `related_sessions`, and the Evidence section.

   **If `success_signal` is non-null** — run the predicate:
   ```
   bun <plugin_root>/scripts/proposal.ts success-signal .claude-code-hermit "<accepted_date>" "<accepted_in_session|null>" "<success_signal>"
   ```
   Parse the one JSON line on stdout. Branch on `verdict`:
   - `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` → skip; add nothing to `resolution_actions` for this proposal.
   - `MET` → auto-resolve. Populate one `resolution_actions` entry:
     ```json
     { "proposal_id": "PROP-NNN",
       "action": "auto-resolve",
       "frontmatter_patch": { "status": "resolved", "resolved_date": "<now ISO>" },
       "shell_findings_line": "PROP-NNN resolved — success signal met: avg session cost $<observed> over <sessions_counted> sessions (target <op> $<threshold>)." }
     ```
   - `UNMET` → nudge if debounce allows. Check `last_sparse_nudge.<PROP-NNN>` (from dispatch prompt or
     reflection-state.json if not in prompt). If present and < 7 days elapsed, skip (add nothing).
     Otherwise, populate one `resolution_actions` entry:
     ```json
     { "proposal_id": "PROP-NNN",
       "action": "nudge",
       "frontmatter_patch": null,
       "shell_findings_line": "PROP-NNN success signal NOT met: avg session cost $<observed> over <sessions_counted> sessions (target <op> $<threshold>). Run /claude-code-hermit:proposal-act resolve|dismiss PROP-NNN, or revise." }
     ```

   **If `success_signal` is null** — use the prose pattern-absence test:

   Read the YAML frontmatter of the 3 most recent `sessions/S-*-REPORT.md` files (sort descending by
   filename, take the top 3): `task`, `tags`, `lessons`, `blockers`, `artifacts`, `next_start`, `status`,
   `date`. Test pattern presence against those fields first. A report whose frontmatter lacks the
   `next_start` key is **legacy** — read it in full (do not truncate its body). For non-legacy
   reports, open the full body only when the pattern concerns prose the frontmatter row cannot witness
   (e.g. Progress Log detail, section wording) — and then only that one report, not all 3. If a body you
   do open exceeds your read window, note the truncation explicitly rather than silently trimming.

   **Same-area guard (absence must be meaningful):** before counting absence, establish work-area overlap —
   collect the proposal's `tags` plus the `tags:` frontmatter of its `related_sessions` reports into a
   tag pool; at least one of the 3 checked sessions must share ≥1 tag from that pool (fallback when the
   pool is empty: a proposal-title keyword match in a session body). If none of the 3 sessions overlaps,
   the absence is vacuous — skip this proposal (add `action: "skip"` to `resolution_actions`).

   **Compute original cadence:** for each report in `related_sessions`, read its `date:` frontmatter.
   `original_cadence_days = max(date) - min(date)` in whole days. Single session → 0. Unreadable /
   empty `related_sessions` → treat as **sparse**.

   If the pattern IS present in any of the 3 sessions: add `action: "skip"`, no other fields.

   If the pattern is **absent** from all 3:
   - **Frequent** (`original_cadence_days ≤ 14`) and ≥ 14 days elapsed since `accepted_date`:
     → auto-resolve (same entry shape as the `MET` branch above). Do not emit a metrics row —
     `apply-reflection-actions.ts` derives the `resolved` row from `proposal_id`.
   - **Sparse** (`original_cadence_days > 14`) and elapsed ≥ `2 × original_cadence_days` since
     `accepted_date` and debounce allows (same `last_sparse_nudge` check as UNMET branch):
     → nudge (populate `shell_findings_line`:
     `"PROP-NNN appears resolved (pattern absent 3/3 recent sessions, original cadence Nd, Xd since accept). Run /claude-code-hermit:proposal-act resolve PROP-NNN to confirm."`)
   - Elapsed guard not yet met: add `action: "skip"`, no other fields.

**d.** Set `last_resolution_check` in the return value to the last PROP-NNN checked (or null if the
   batch was empty).

**e.** Set the top-level `last_sparse_nudge` return field to the union of every proposal nudged this
   run: for each `resolution_actions` entry with `action: "nudge"` (both the UNMET and sparse-pattern
   branches above), add `{ "PROP-NNN": "<now ISO>" }`. Emit `{}` if no proposal was nudged. This
   top-level map is the only nudge write-back — the calling session merges it into `reflection-state.json`
   to honour the 7-day debounce. Do not return nudge timestamps inside the individual `resolution_actions`
   entries; only the top-level map is read.

## Step 2 — Routine Check

Run this step only if `session_state` in `.claude-code-hermit/state/runtime.json` is `idle` (the
calling skill reads runtime.json in main; the dispatch prompt may pass this). If not in idle state,
emit `routine_candidates: []` and skip this step.

Run this once and use its output for every detection below. Do not read
`routine-metrics.jsonl` or `cost-log.jsonl` yourself — the counting, the 14-day window, and the
cost attribution are all this script's job:

```
bun <plugin_root>/scripts/routines.ts health .claude-code-hermit --days 14
```

It prints one JSON object:

- `source` — `ok` | `missing` | `unreadable`. If it is not `ok`, emit `routine_candidates: []` and
  skip the rest of this step: an unreadable ledger is not evidence that routines are healthy.
- `malformed_rows` — corrupt ledger lines skipped. Mention in a finding only if non-zero.
- `routines[]` — per routine: `fires`, `failures` (counts keyed by bare reason),
  `failure_total`, `incomplete`, `orphan_terminals`, `open_attempt`, `unhandled`,
  `unhandled_open`, `skips`, `last_fire`, `cost_usd`.
- `unattributable_multi_cost_usd` — spend from wakes that served two or more routines at once. It
  belongs to no single routine; never fold it into one routine's evidence.

**Errored-routine detection:**

`incomplete` counts attempts that started and never reached a terminal row — a crash, a killed
session, a hung skill. If `incomplete >= 2` for a routine, produce a `routine_candidates` entry:

```json
{ "routine_id": "<id>", "action": "diagnostic", "tier": 1, "schedule": null,
  "evidence": "routine '<id>' started but never completed N× in the last 14 days",
  "sessions": [],
  "shell_findings_line": "routine '<id>' started but never completed N× in the last 14 days — its output and cost are unattributed." }
```

`unhandled` counts emits the session never picked up — fired but the session never ran the
wrapper, so the fire and its cost are unrecorded. If `unhandled >= 2` for a routine, produce
the same entry shape with that wording, not the crash wording.

**Failed-contract detection:**

`failures` is a different fault and gets different wording: the routine ran and its declared
`expect_artifact` contract was not met (`artifact-missing`, `artifact-unchanged`,
`verification-error`). If `failure_total >= 2`, produce the same entry shape naming the dominant
reason — "routine '<id>' ran but its output did not land (artifact-missing) N× in the last 14
days" — not the generic errored wording. These are not crashes and the fix is different.

`orphan_terminals` (a terminal row with no matching start) and `open_attempt` (an attempt still
running at the window edge) are diagnostic context, not candidates on their own. `unhandled_open`
is the same for a dispatch still open at the window edge; on a routine that fires less often than
the window it is more likely a dropped wake than a live turn.

**Uncited-routine detection:**

For each routine with `fires >= 5`: read the 3 most recent `sessions/S-*-REPORT.md`
(reuse the frontmatter rows already read in Step 1 if available; open a body only for a legacy report
or when the row's `task`/`lessons`/`artifacts` don't settle the citation check). If no session report cites the routine's
`routine_id` or skill output as producing findings, decisions, or follow-ups — apply the
Three-Condition Rule:
1. Repeated pattern: ≥5 fires with zero citation.
2. Meaningful consequence: routine runs but produces no downstream effect.
3. Operator-actionable: disable or reschedule.
If all three hold, produce a `routine_candidates` entry with `action: "disable"` or `"retime"` (prefer
retime if timing mismatch is apparent from `last_fire` vs. session activity times). Quantify the
consequence with the routine's own `cost_usd` from the health output — that is the spend buying
nothing:
```json
{ "routine_id": "<id>", "action": "disable", "tier": 1, "schedule": null,
  "evidence": "<fire count + window + citation count + $cost_usd over the window>",
  "sessions": ["<S-NNN>", ...],
  "shell_findings_line": null }
```

## Step 3 — Procedure-Capture Detection

Run this step only if `compute` is listed in `phases_json`.

Read three sources directly:

1. The operator's `MEMORY.md` index, in the auto-memory directory named in your dispatch (`memory-dir`).
   Look for workflow-pattern entries (topic files flagged as workflow patterns, lines with `workflow` in the
   description).

2. The `lessons` frontmatter array of the 3 most recent `sessions/S-*-REPORT.md` files (reuse the rows
   from Step 1 if available). For a legacy report (no `next_start` frontmatter key), read its `## Lessons`
   section instead.

3. The `## Completed` section of the same 3 most recent `sessions/S-*-REPORT.md` files (written in every
   close mode, so auto-closed sessions count). It is the session's Progress Log verbatim, so it mixes
   real work with bookkeeping: timestamped lifecycle lines (task switches, heartbeat and auto-close
   notices, guest reports, routine fires) are not procedures — read only entries describing work the
   hermit carried out by hand. Recurrence signal and output schema are unchanged.

**Recurrence signal:** the same multi-step procedure appears as a Lesson, a `## Completed` item, or memory workflow-pattern in
**≥ `graduation_min_sessions` distinct archived sessions** (read from `.claude-code-hermit/config.json`
at `reflection.graduation_min_sessions`; default 1 if absent) and no existing skill covers it (the
"existing skill" check runs in the main session — do not Glob `.claude/skills/` here; the main session
handles dedup).

For each recurring procedure found, produce one `procedure_candidates` entry:
```json
{ "slug": "<kebab-case-slug>",
  "title": "<human-readable title>",
  "tier": 3,
  "evidence_source": "archived-session",
  "evidence_origin": "own-work",
  "evidence": "<which sessions, what Lessons/patterns showed the recurrence>",
  "sessions": ["<S-NNN>", "<S-MMM>"],
  "artifact": null }
```

Set `evidence_origin` to `"external-content"` if the procedure was originally learned from external
content (web fetches, `raw/` captures, channel messages).

Emit `procedure_candidates: []` if no recurring procedures are found.

**Ownership signal:** additionally, emit one entry per MEMORY.md preference that records an explicit
operator endpoint for a task-scoped output ("from now on, always X" — a settled voice, template,
format, decision rule, or quality bar). Use the same entry shape with `evidence_source: "settled-memory"`
(the override for this signal only — recurrence is not required; the recorded endpoint declaration is
the human-initiated evidence; the shape's `tier` is ignored for these — the main session's
`skill-preference:*` routing sets it). `evidence` must cite the memory topic **filename** plus the **verbatim
endpoint line** (the main session's judge greps for it; the filename doubles as the dedup key — derive
`title` from it). Emit nothing for session-wide one-liners (memory is their correct home) and nothing
for pointer-form memories that already name the skill or surface holding the content (already placed), or for hook lines tagged `[role` (channel standing roles whose home is memory).
Do not read skill files or prose surfaces to check ownership — the main session owns that; your
evidence is the memory entry alone.

## Return Value

Return a single JSON object — no prose, no markdown wrapping. Every field is required; use `[]` / `null`
/ `{}` for empty values, never omit a key.

<!-- reflect-eval-schema:start -->
```json
{
  "resolution_actions": [ { "proposal_id": "PROP-NNN", "action": "auto-resolve|nudge|skip",
                            "frontmatter_patch": {"status":"resolved","resolved_date":"<ISO>"}|null,
                            "shell_findings_line": "<pre-rendered finding text>"|null } ],
  "routine_candidates": [ { "routine_id": "<id>", "action": "disable|retime|diagnostic",
                            "tier": 1, "schedule": "<new-cron>"|null,
                            "evidence": "<text>", "sessions": ["<S-NNN>"],
                            "shell_findings_line": "<pre-rendered>"|null } ],
  "procedure_candidates": [ { "slug": "<slug>", "title": "<title>", "tier": 3,
                              "evidence_source": "archived-session", "evidence_origin": "own-work",
                              "evidence": "<text>", "sessions": ["<S-NNN>"]|"none",
                              "artifact": "<file — value>"|null } ],
  "last_resolution_check": "PROP-NNN|null",
  "last_sparse_nudge": { "PROP-NNN": "<ISO>" }
}
```
<!-- reflect-eval-schema:end -->

`resolution_actions` and the two cursor fields are applied directly by the calling session. `routine_candidates` and `procedure_candidates` carry cross-session evidence and go through `reflection-judge` then `proposal-triage` before any proposal is created. Applied fields carry the exact string the main session writes — no recomputation needed.
