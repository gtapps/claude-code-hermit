# What Your Assistant Can and Cannot Do

A plain-language answer to "what is this thing actually allowed to do?" — written for the owner, not the developer. It's derived from the technical [Security](security.md) doc, and it's deliberately honest: it says where the guarantees are real and where they're a strong habit rather than an unbreakable rule.

## Always true

These are hard limits — enforced mechanically, not just as good behavior:

- It will never run a command that wipes your whole disk, destroys a drive, or takes down the system it's running on. Those specific dangerous actions are blocked no matter what, regardless of anything it decides in the moment.
- If it was set up the recommended way (the always-on container setup), it's also blocked from pushing code changes to your team's shared repository without approval first. On other setups this protection may not be switched on — ask whoever installed it if you're unsure which applies to you.

## How it normally works

These are the assistant's everyday habits — real, and followed consistently, but not absolute walls:

- Before making a significant or risky change, it shows you a draft and waits for your OK rather than just doing it (see [Approve](owners-guide.md#approve)).
- It tracks what it spends on AI usage and can warn you or pause itself against a spending limit you set.
- It generally stays scoped to the project it's working in, rather than roaming freely across your whole computer.

## Honest limits

Nobody should be told this is a sealed box, so here's what it isn't:

- By default, it can still read files and reach the internet — those aren't blocked automatically. If your work needs that locked down, ask whoever set this up about the stronger, opt-in network protection.
- The "shows me a draft first" habit above is just that — a habit the assistant follows, not a guarantee enforced the way the destructive-action blocks are. In an unusual or confusing situation, it could occasionally act without asking first.
- This isn't a substitute for basic caution. Don't give it access to anything you wouldn't want touched, and keep an eye on what it's doing — especially in the first few weeks.

If your situation needs stronger guarantees than described here — handling sensitive client data, for example — talk to whoever set this up about running it inside a more locked-down environment.
