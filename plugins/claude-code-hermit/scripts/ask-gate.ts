// PreToolUse hook (matcher "AskUserQuestion") — binds the last unbound
// synchronous-ask path on unattended sessions. PROP-017 covers hermit-owned
// skills cooperatively (Step-0 marker + static contract test); this gate
// binds everything else — built-ins, other plugins' skills, spontaneous
// model-initiated questions — the caller surface that grows with every
// plugin the operator installs.
//
// Deny mechanics mirror pause-gate.ts: probe-verified
// (compiled/spike-channel-stop-probe-2026-07-03.md) that a PreToolUse exit-2
// deny is binding within one tool call with zero model cooperation. The
// deny-steering behavior specific to this gate — does the model retry the
// tool or follow the reason into an alternate action — is probe-verified in
// compiled/spike-ask-gate-probe-2026-07-05.md: it does not retry.
//
// Only denies when there's actually somewhere for the question to go AND this
// is genuinely the unattended surface: always_on config, an eligible outbound
// channel, the operator hasn't opted out (ask_gate:false / HERMIT_ASK_GATE=off),
// and the process carries the HERMIT_MANAGED marker. That marker is stamped into
// the managed session's tmux env-file by hermit-start (never settings.local.json
// or the docker-compose env block), so it identifies THIS process as the
// background session rather than relying on the project-wide always_on flag —
// which every `claude` in the dir reads alike. A hand-launched maintenance
// `claude` (or a `docker exec` shell) lacks the marker and is left untouched, so
// its interactive AskUserQuestion flows (/hermit-evolve, /hermit-settings,
// /docker-setup, ...) are not denied out from under a present operator.
//
// Fail direction: lean allow. A false "attended" (allowed but nobody watching)
// is backstopped by the watchdog's stall-question detector, which fail-loudly
// notifies the operator. A false "unattended" (denied with a human present) has
// no backstop — it just breaks the flow. So every ambiguity resolves to allow.
//
// Fail-open: any error here (bad stdin, missing/corrupt config) resolves to
// exit 0 (allow) — a hook must never block Claude Code.
