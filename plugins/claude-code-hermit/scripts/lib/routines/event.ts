// cron-create (default) | monitor. The monitor stamps `dispatched` at emit; the

// the serialized byte order any more. Cost attribution moved to the cost log's
// v2 rows, and the doctor's routine-cost check went with it.

// A hatched project (config.json) wins, so the walk goes PAST a config-less
// `.claude-code-hermit/`. That does NOT single out a git worktree's partial copy:
// the copy carries config.json, because the dev hermit's /dev-quality and /dev-pr
// read commands.test and commands.pr_create from it. Discriminating the worktree
// case needs a sentinel the copy does not carry, and belongs in hermitDir()
// rather than here.
//
// A bare `.claude-code-hermit/` still counts on the second pass, because
// config-less is a shipped state, not only a decoy: hatch scaffolds the tree
// (Step 2) before the wizard writes config.json (Step 5), and an aborted hatch
// can leave it that way indefinitely. Refusing there would drop the row silently
// — every caller discards the error string below — and a short ledger still reads
// `source: 'ok'` to routines/health.ts, turning a lost row into a false zero the
// model may act on. Falling back also keeps this consistent with hermitDir(),
// which fail-opens to the same dir when no config is found.
