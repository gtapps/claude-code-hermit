/**
 * Shared cross-runtime liveness signal.
 *
 * The monitor subprocesses (routine-monitor.sh, heartbeat-monitor.sh) and the
 * cost tracker write these files under the project state dir — which is
 * bind-mounted into the Docker container at the same path — and they die with
 * the claude process that spawned them. So a fresh mtime on any of them proves
 * *some* instance of this project is alive right now, readable identically from
 * the host or from inside the container, with no shared PID namespace required.
 *
 * Asymmetry that matters: fresh proves alive; stale proves nothing. The routine
 * monitor writes every 60s, but heartbeat-liveness tracks `heartbeat.every`
 * (can be hours) and .status.json only updates on activity, so with routines
 * disabled or the Monitor tool unavailable an idle-but-alive instance reads
 * stale within minutes. Callers must treat a stale/absent signal as "unknown",
 * never "dead" — every guard keyed off this fails toward today's behavior.
