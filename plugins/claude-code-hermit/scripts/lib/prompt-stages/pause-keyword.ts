// UserPromptSubmit stage — deterministic pause/resume/snooze keyword writer
// (PROP-015). Writes state/pause.json directly from an inbound <channel>
// envelope, before any model involvement, so pause/resume never depends on
// model cooperation or on a tool call the pause-gate itself might deny.
//
// Mid-turn channel arrivals are queued and run UserPromptSubmit individually
// (CC 2.1.263), so these keywords are handled when each queued prompt is delivered.
//
// Gated by the same allowed_users allowlist as channel-reply-reminder.ts
// (lib/channel-auth.ts's isAllowedSender, shared by both; also see
// channel-responder/SKILL.md 1c) — an unauthorized sender's message is a
// silent no-op: no state change, no stdout, so the mechanism can't be probed
// by an unauthorized prompt.
