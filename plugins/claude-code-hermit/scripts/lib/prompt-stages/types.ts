// The contract every UserPromptSubmit stage implements.
//
// Stages are plain functions, not scripts: they never read stdin, never write
// stdout, and never call process.exit. They return what they want emitted and
// let user-prompt-pipeline.ts decide — which is what makes the "a block emits
// JSON alone" rule enforceable in one place instead of seven.

// Re-exported, never redeclared: parseChannelEnvelope is the only producer, and
// a structurally-compatible copy here silently drifts from it (a field added to
// the parser stayed invisible to every stage until a typecheck caught it).
