/**
 * PostToolUse hook — appends a usage event to state/usage-metrics.jsonl when a
 * compiled/ artifact is read.
 *
 * Compiled reads feed weekly-review's "no tracked use" section, which
 * auto-archives on that evidence. Subagent reads ARE captured: PostToolUse
 * fires for sidechain tool calls, with the parent session_id in the payload
 * (probed on CC 2.1.239).
 *
 * Coverage gaps that remain, and why "no tracked use" is weaker than "unused":
 * startup-context injection; Reads whose PostToolUse payload (tool_response
 * carries the full file body) exceeds MAX_STDIN; and the write-then-deliver
 * path, where a doc the hermit authors and relays over a channel is never Read
 * at all. `procedure-brief` artifacts are additionally excluded from the
 * startup catalog, so nothing surfaces them. Docs are therefore only eligible
 * once their own created/updated date is past the window, and weekly-review
 * gates archiving on the ledger having recorded at least one compiled read.
 *
 * Fails open on every error path — never blocks Claude Code. Zero stdout.
