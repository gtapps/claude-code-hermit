// stop-failure-stamp.ts — StopFailure hook
//
// Claude Code fires StopFailure when a turn ends in an upstream failure instead
// of an assistant reply. The payload carries a typed `error` (the live key; the
// docs spell it `error_type`), so this is the one place the failure category is
// known rather than inferred from rendered error text.
//
// The hook only records. It writes state/stop-failure.json and stops there: the
// watchdog owns the notification, and stop-pipeline.ts deletes the stamp on the
// next healthy Stop. Guest sessions write nothing, the same residency gate every
// other state-writing hook applies — one hermit folder, one resident writer.
//
// Fail-open and side-effect-only: every path exits 0 with empty stdout.

  // into notifying the operator about an outage that never happened.
