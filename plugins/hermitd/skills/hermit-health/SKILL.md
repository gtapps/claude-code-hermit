# Hermit Health

Synthesize a compact "state of the hermit" snapshot in two halves: infrastructure (active alerts, proposal queue, routine engagement, knowledge state, channel readiness) and analysis (fragile zones, stale accepted proposals, recent learnings). Everything is read directly in main — this skill is on-demand and runner-free.

## Step 0 — Channel reply

If this skill was invoked from a channel-arrived message (the inbound prompt contains a `<channel source="...">` tag), reply via that channel's reply tool. Otherwise emit to conversation.

## Scope

Read the following (gracefully skip any file that doesn't exist). The sources are independent — read them concurrently:

1. `.hermit/state/alert-state.json` — the `alerts` object, keyed by alert id (`checklist:*`, `proposal-pending:PROP-NNN`, `micro-proposal-pending:*`). Each entry has `text`, `count`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `suppressed`, `consecutive_clean`.
2. `.hermit/state/runtime.json` — `last_activity`, `session_id`.
3. `.hermit/state/reflection-state.json` — `last_reflection` timestamp, `counters` (including `judge_suppress_by_code` map and run/output fields), and `queue` (pending micro-proposals and reflect candidates).
4. `.hermit/config.json` — `routines` array (id, schedule, enabled); `channels` object (each channel's `default_chat_id` and `dm_channel_id`).
5. `.hermit/proposals/PROP-*.md` — glob; count by `status` frontmatter field, and read `id`, `title`, `accepted_date`, `resolved_date`, `tags` for the stale-proposal and fragile-zone analysis.
6. `.hermit/state/micro-proposals.json` — count entries with `status: "pending"`.
7. Glob counts: `.hermit/raw/**` (excluding `.archive/`), `.hermit/compiled/**`, `.hermit/raw/.archive/**`.
8. `bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/task-report.ts .hermit --limit 5` for normalized recent task records: titles, outcomes, waiting reasons and lessons. Never read frozen session archives or the old live shell document.

## Analysis

**Alerts:** From `alert-state.json → alerts`, active means `suppressed` is not `true`; suppressed ones are digest-only and reported separately. Compute each entry's age from `first_seen`. Report the active count with the oldest entry's `text` and age, then the suppressed count with its oldest age. If no active entries: "No active alerts" (still name the suppressed count when there is one).

**Proposal queue:** Count proposals with `status: proposed` (pending operator review), `status: accepted` (in flight, not yet resolved), and `status: in_progress`. If all zero: "Queue empty."

**Routine engagement:** From `config.json.routines`, list each routine and its schedule. For the `reflect` routine, use `reflection-state.json → last_reflection` to show when it last ran; also append counter info from `reflection-state.json → counters`: apply the reflect-line rules below, then append the suppress-mix suffix if any `judge_suppress_by_code` code has a non-zero count: `suppress mix — no-evidence:N, covered-by-memory:N, no-sessions:N` (omit codes with count 0; omit the suffix entirely when all counts are 0 or the map is absent). For every routine, run `bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/routines.ts health .hermit` once and take last run, fire count and skip reason from its rows.

**Reflect-line rules** (applied to the reflect routine bullet):
- If `counters` is absent: omit the counter clause entirely
- If `total_runs` is 0: show `no runs yet (since YYYY-MM-DD)` where the date is `counters.since`
- Otherwise: `N runs, N empty | output: N proposals, N micro | since YYYY-MM-DD` where the date is `counters.since` — omit `| output: ...` if both `proposals_created` and `micro_proposals_queued` are 0

**Micro:** Count entries with `status: "pending"` in `micro-proposals.json`. Omit this section entirely if count is zero.

**Knowledge:** Report glob counts for raw (excl. archive), compiled, and archived files. Omit if all three are zero and the directories are missing. If the operator explicitly asked to check or lint knowledge (phrasing like "check knowledge", "lint knowledge", "knowledge health"), also run `bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/knowledge-lint.ts .hermit` and relay its findings verbatim (grouped by type with file paths, ages, and actionable advice) beneath the counts. The script is strictly read-only.

**Channel availability:** From `config.json.channels`, for each configured channel, check whether `default_chat_id` or (failing that) `dm_channel_id` is set — the same fallback chain the outbound resolver uses. Report "ready" or "not yet paired (no chat id — send a message first)".

**Fragile zones:** From the last five normalized task records, identify repeated themes in cancelled outcomes and open waiting reasons. Combine these with proposal tags for dismissed or blocked proposals. Surface the top two or three themes with the actual outcomes; unconfirmed is not completed. If none recur, report "No fragile zones detected."

**Stale proposals:** From proposals, find those with `status: accepted` and `resolved_date` absent or `null`. Sort by `accepted_date` ascending (oldest first). Show up to 3. Compute days open = today minus `accepted_date`. If none: "No accepted proposals awaiting resolution."

**Recent learnings:** From `reflection-state.json`, read `queue` entries with `status: accepted` or `status: pending` and surface the most recent 3 question/observation fields. If the queue is empty or absent, use the normalized records’ `lessons`. Surface top 3. If nothing: "No recent learnings — reflect hasn't run yet."

## Output

Reply in ≤1500 chars. Use exactly this section structure:

```
### Alerts
- N active (oldest: [text] Xd ago), M suppressed (oldest Xd ago) [with N = 0: "No active alerts, M suppressed (oldest Xd ago)"; omit the suppressed clause entirely when M is 0]
(or: Alerts — alert-state.json not found (hermit not yet initialized).)

### Proposal queue
- N proposed (pending review), N accepted (in flight), N in_progress
(or: Queue empty.)

### Routine engagement
- [id]: enabled, schedule [cron], [last ran Xh ago | N runs, N empty | output: N proposals, N micro | since YYYY-MM-DD] [suppress mix suffix if applicable]
- [id]: disabled
(or: Routine engagement — config.json not found.)

### Micro
- N pending decision
(omit section entirely if zero pending)

### Knowledge
- N raw, N compiled, N archived

### Channel availability
- [channel]: ready (chat id set) [or "not yet paired"]
(or: No channels configured — type /hermitd:channel-setup in a terminal or the Claude app.)

### Fragile zones
- [tag or theme]: [one-line reason]
(or: No fragile zones detected — no recurring cancelled or waiting tasks yet.)

### Stale proposals
- PROP-NNN: [title] (accepted N days ago)
(or: No accepted proposals awaiting resolution.)

### Recent learnings
- [learning]
(or: No recent learnings — reflect hasn't run yet.)
```

Omit sections that have no data rather than showing a heading with an empty body. Keep each bullet to one line. If the assembled report would exceed 1500 chars, keep Alerts, Proposal queue, and Fragile zones in full and truncate the longer lists (Routine engagement, Recent learnings) to their top 2 entries.
