name: capability-brainstorm
description: Monthly routine plus on-demand hermit-voice brainstorm — synthesizes memory, capabilities, recent artifacts, and codebase shape into at most 2 capability ideas, each gated by proposal-triage before becoming a PROP. Runs on the capability-brainstorm routine and when the operator asks to brainstorm capabilities or ideate, e.g. "brainstorm capabilities", "what could you be doing for me?", "any capability ideas?".

Record notes only inside an open record's turn, using `bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/task.ts note .hermit <id>` with the note on stdin. Otherwise skip record notes. Never edit a task file directly.

# Capability Brainstorm

## Kill criteria (read before running)

After ≥8 invocations, run:

```
bun ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/proposal.ts metrics .hermit --source=capability-brainstorm
```

Triage-survival < 25% or acceptance < 30% → cut this skill rather than tune it — the signal-to-noise ratio isn't there. `INSUFFICIENT` output means the ≥8-verdict sample hasn't been reached yet; wait and re-check.

## 1. Gather capability signals (harness-context — read before dispatch)

These three sources require the main session's harness context and cannot be delegated:

- *Skills:* use the harness available-skills list loaded in your context — that is authoritative.
- *MCPs:* call `ListMcpResourcesTool` to enumerate currently online MCP tools.
- *Channels:* read `config.json` → `channels` keys.

## 2. Dispatch the eval runner

Pass the capability signals from Step 1 in the dispatch prompt. Dispatch `hermitd:skill-eval-runner` pointed at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/capability-brainstorm/reference.md`. Include in the dispatch prompt:
- `plugin_root`: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (resolved absolute path — the runner needs it for the sibling-scan, since `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not substituted in `reference.md` content)
- `skills_list`: the harness available-skills list (one skill per line)
- `mcp_tools`: the `ListMcpResourcesTool` output
- `channels_keys`: the `channels` key list from config.json

The runner reads memory topic files, compiled artifacts, and codebase shape in an isolated context, generates ≤2 ideas (applying the friction + grounding constraints), and returns the structured result.

**Eval runner return schema** — the runner's return value is a JSON object conforming to this block. The schema is byte-identical in `reference.md` (producer) and here (consumer); a contract test asserts this.

<!-- brainstorm-eval-schema:start -->
```json
{
  "ideas": [
    {
      "title": "<short idea title>",
      "description": "<one-line description>",
      "friction": "<one-sentence operator pain>",
      "grounding": ["<item 1>", "<item 2>"],
      "effort": "hours|days",
      "evidence_summary": "<one-paragraph friction + grounding for proposal-create>"
    }
  ],
  "discarded": ["<one-line discarded idea>"],
  "inputs_scanned": ["<title or path of each source scanned>"]
}
```
<!-- brainstorm-eval-schema:end -->

**Failure policy:** if the runner returns null or malformed JSON, treat as a zero-ideas result — proceed to Steps 3–5 with `ideas: []`, `discarded: []`, `inputs_scanned: []`, and note the failure in the batch message as `0 ideas emitted (analysis-runner failed)`.

## 3. Create proposals (single-pass via `/hermitd:proposal-create`)

For each generated idea, invoke `/hermitd:proposal-create` once with:

```
Title: <short idea title>
Evidence Source: capability-brainstorm
Evidence: <one-paragraph summary: friction + grounding items>
```

Set the PROP frontmatter:
- `source: auto-detected`
- `category: capability`
- `tags: [capability-brainstorm, ideation]`

`/hermitd:proposal-create` invokes `proposal-triage` internally. Parse its outcome:
- `CREATE: <title>` — PROP file written, note the assigned PROP-NNN.
- `SUPPRESS: <title> — <code>` — record the suppression code. Don't retry.
- `DUPLICATE: <title> — <PROP-ID>` — record the existing PROP-ID. Don't create.

Do NOT invoke `proposal-triage` directly in this skill — `/hermitd:proposal-create` already does it.

## 4. Emit batch message

Send one message per `CLAUDE-APPEND.md` § Operator Notification (`channel-send.ts --notice`; it asks for decisions, so it needs a `client` leg):

```
🧠 Capability brainstorm (<N> idea(s))

1. **<short title>** — <one-line description>
   _Grounding: <item 1>, <item 2>_
   _Friction: <one-sentence pain>_
   _Estimated effort: <hours|days>_
   PROP-NNN created  ·  (or: suppressed — <code>  ·  or: duplicate of PROP-NNN)

2. **<short title>** — ...

📎 <proposals page URL>
```

The `📎` line is a single slot for the whole batch, not one per idea — omit it entirely when the proposals-page refresh returned no URL.

If zero ideas were generated or all were suppressed/duplicated, the message is:
```
🧠 Capability brainstorm — 0 ideas emitted (<reason: thin context | all suppressed | all duplicates>)
```

## 5. Write compiled artifact (non-empty runs only)

If ≥1 PROP was created (not suppressed/duplicate), write:

`.hermit/compiled/capability-brainstorm-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md`

Frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: Capability brainstorm — <ISO timestamp>
type: capability-brainstorm
created: <ISO timestamp with timezone>
tags: [capability-brainstorm, ideation]
source: <interactive when the operator asked; routine when the capability-brainstorm routine fired>
proposals_created: [PROP-NNN, ...]
---
```

Body (cover the substance, no filler sections):
- Ideas that passed generation and triage — one paragraph each.
- Discarded ideas — one line each (no grounding, no concrete friction).
- Triage verdicts for each emitted idea (CREATE / SUPPRESS — code / DUPLICATE:ID).
- Inputs scanned — titles/paths only, no content.

Do not tag `foundational` — this is a time-bounded ideation snapshot.

**Zero-emit runs:** skip the artifact entirely. Log one line to open record notes:
`capability-brainstorm: 0 ideas emitted (<reason>)`
