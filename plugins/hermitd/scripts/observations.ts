// Replaces append-metrics.ts, which took an arbitrary path and arbitrary JSON and

//
// Stdin-only by design. The label is the only free-text field, and a free-text
// value in single-quoted argv breaks the moment it contains an apostrophe — the
// hazard the old script's dual argv/stdin mode existed to work around. Once the
// computed sources moved to the scripts that compute them (reflect-precheck,
// transcript-digest), every remaining caller passes model-authored prose, so
// there is no argv case left to serve and no quoting rule to document.
//
// Exit 0 always; the verdict is the stdout line (OK | ERROR|<token>), matching
// proposal.ts. A metrics row is telemetry — it must never abort a skill step.
