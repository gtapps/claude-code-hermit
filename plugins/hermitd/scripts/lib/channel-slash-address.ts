// Shared slash-command *addressing* for inbound channel messages — used by the
// pause-keyword, harness-command and channel-status-responder stages in
// lib/prompt-stages/.
//
// Deliberately NOT a tokenizer. It answers two questions only — "is this a slash
// command?" and "is it addressed to us?" — and hands the remainder back
// untouched. Each command family keeps its own argument grammar downstream:
// harness-command.ts splits on a single space and enforces exact token counts,
// while pause-keyword accepts `\s+` before a snooze duration. Centralizing the
// split too would force both through one rule and silently narrow `/snooze  2h`.
//
// Two address forms, both transport-neutral — a channel gets whichever its
// stored identity supports, not whichever platform it happens to be:
//
//   suffix   `/pause@thebot`   Telegram's group convention, where a client
//                              rewrites a command picked from the bot menu.
//   prefix   `<@id> /pause`    a leading self-mention. Mention-gated channels
//            `@thebot /pause`  are the default for a server channel, and the
//                              plugin hands the mention through verbatim, so
//                              without this every command there is inert.
//
// Both fail closed the same way: the address must name THIS bot. A command
// aimed at another bot in a shared group is not ours to act on, an unknown
// identity can never authorize its own form, and either way the body reaches
// the model as ordinary prose instead of being acted on.
//
// Addressing only — never authorization. Who may actually pause, resume or
// interrogate the hermit is decided downstream by channel-auth.ts's
// isTrustedController/isAllowedSender, which this layer does not consult and
// cannot widen.
