// state/routine-metrics.jsonl → an ordered per-routine attempt projection.
//
// The ledger records six event kinds: `dispatched` (due.ts, at emit),
// `started` (precheck, at fire time),
// `fired` / `failed-<reason>` (finish — exactly one terminal per attempt),
// `skipped-*` (due.ts gates, which open no attempt at all), and `precheck-error`
// (a declared wake gate that could not answer, so the fire woke anyway — the one
// non-terminal row that means the opposite of a skip). Counting those
// independently — the `errored = started − fired` arithmetic this replaces — is
// wrong in three ways the fold below fixes:
//
//   - `finish` writes a terminal row with no preceding `started` when precheck
//     never stamped one (finish.ts's no-run-record branch), so a subtraction can
//     run negative and mask a real gap elsewhere.
//   - an attempt still open at the window edge is indistinguishable from a
//     crashed one under subtraction. Here it stays `open_attempt`, uncounted,
//     until a later event resolves it.
//   - an attempt straddling the window start belongs to its own attempt, not to
//     the window's counters.
//
// The fold is ordered per routine and carries attempt state across the window
// boundary; only in-window events increment counters.
