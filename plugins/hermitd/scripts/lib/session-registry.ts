/**
 * Claude Code's own session registry, read as a liveness oracle.
 *
 * Every session writes `<config dir>/sessions/<pid>.json` describing itself, and
 * rewrites `status` as it moves between states. Probed live: `busy` = a model
 * turn is running, `shell` = a Bash tool is executing (a backgrounded one too),
 * `waiting` = the session is blocked on a permission dialog, `idle` ~3s after a
 * turn ends. The file is deleted on a clean exit and survives only an unclean
 * kill.
 *
 * `statusUpdatedAt` moves ONLY on a transition — a 95s turn keeps its
 * turn-start stamp — so it dates the CURRENT state, never the last sign of
 * life. That is what it is used for here (how long the session has been idle
 * since a wake was posted), and it is why it cannot stand in for a heartbeat.
 *
 * The format is undocumented: the cross-session-messaging docs describe the
 * socket but never this file. So every consumer must degrade to its existing
 * behavior when a read returns null, and none may depend on a field being
 * present. Validation is deliberately strict for the same reason — a stale
 * entry at a reused pid is the failure mode this exists to avoid, observed on
 * a live host (a 7h-old `shell` entry whose pid had been recycled).
