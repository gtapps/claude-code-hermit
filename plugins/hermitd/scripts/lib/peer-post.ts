/**
 * Post a message into another Claude Code session's inbox socket.
 *
 * Claude Code binds a per-session Unix socket and delivers whatever arrives on
 * it as a user turn: immediately when the session is idle, at the next tool
 * boundary when it is mid-turn. That is the whole appeal over typing
 * into a tmux pane — no pane state, no Escape/Enter choreography, no keystrokes
 * swallowed by a running tool.
 *
 * Wire format is newline-delimited JSON: an optional
 * `{"type":"auth","token":…}` line (required only on native Windows; the token
 * is a session's own `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN`), then
 * `{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"…"}}`. The daemon closes
 * a connection that hasn't sent a complete line within 30s, so the payload is
 * built before connecting, never streamed.
 *
 * The verdict is deliberately two-valued. A successful write means the bytes
 * reached the socket, NOT that the model read them: the receiving session
 * applies its own inbound controls afterwards, and both ways it can drop the
 * message are invisible to us — `crossSessionInbound: refuse` drops silently,
 * and a receiver whose inbound controls still hold an unauthenticated post (one
 * launched without the hermit's `accept` overlay, or an operator-set `hold`)
 * leaves it behind an approval dialog that expires in five minutes. A model
 * that declines to act on the text is equally unobservable. So callers must
 * never read 'sent' as
 * "delivered"; confirm the effect instead (the watchdog re-checks staleness on
 * the next tick and falls back to typing).
