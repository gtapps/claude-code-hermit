// Shared context-reset bookkeeping.
//
// Destroying a context (/clear) or shrinking it (/compact) is not just a keystroke:
// hermit-owned state has to be updated in the same breath or the hermit's own view
// of the world silently disagrees with reality. Before this lib the sequence lived
// only inside hermitd-watchdog.ts's private context reset tiers, so
// any other caller — notably an operator-initiated reset arriving over a channel —
// would have bypassed it.
//
// What stays OUT of here on purpose: the cost-log idempotence stamps
// (last_compacted_cost_ts / last_pane_hash_compact) and
// setHygieneEval. Those exist to stop a *threshold-triggered* reset re-firing against
// the same cost entry; a reset the operator asked for has no cost entry and no
// threshold, so they are the watchdog's business, not this lib's. Callers also own
// their own keystroke and event-log line, which legitimately differ per trigger.

 * context that no longer exists. Every reset path records it — manual or native-auto
 * /compact through this function (precompact-stamp.ts), /clear through
 * applyContextReset's own write — because the watchdog's own last_compacted_at only
 * ever sees the resets it caused.
 *
 * Fresh read-modify-write against an absolute path: hooks don't share a cwd, and a
 * cached runtime object would clobber fields another process wrote meanwhile. Fail-open
 * and never fabricates a partial runtime.json (unrelated keys must survive).
