// UserPromptSubmit stage — deterministic shutdown gate.
//
// While a shutdown is pending (runtime.json has shutdown_requested_at set and
// shutdown_completed_at null), a <channel> message from an allowed sender gets a
// deterministic "shutting down" reply and is blocked from reaching the model, so
// the hermit stops accepting new work the instant a stop is in flight (the
// incident: the model kept taking channel tasks after acknowledging shutdown).
//
// Send-then-block, mirroring channel-status-responder: only emit
// {"decision":"block"} after a confirmed successful send, so a failed send never
// silently swallows the operator's message — it falls through with a narrow relay
// instruction instead. Non-channel prompts (operator terminal input, the internal
// configured shutdown skill hermitd-stop injects) are never a channel envelope and
// pass through untouched.
