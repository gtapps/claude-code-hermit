// UserPromptSubmit stage — report a delivered harness switch back to the session, from
// the transcript for /model and /effort, and from the pane for /permission-mode.
//
// The gap this closes: the native command applied successfully, but the model's sense of WHICH model it is running is
// fixed at session start and does not follow the switch. Asked "did it work?", the
// session answered from that stale self-perception and reported a working switch as a
// silent failure — twice, on two hermits, one of which then filed an upstream bug for
// a bug that did not exist.
//
// So the answer comes from the transcript instead, where the serving model is stamped
// on every assistant entry. This stage states the fact and nothing more; how it reaches
// the operator is the model's business.
//
// The timestamp gate is the whole correctness argument: on the prompt immediately after
// delivery the newest assistant entry is still the PRE-switch one, so reporting it would
// reproduce exactly the stale answer this exists to prevent. Until an entry newer than
// the delivery exists, the marker is held and the session is told only that its
// self-perception may be stale.
