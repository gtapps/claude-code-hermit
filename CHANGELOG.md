## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **implementer: stronger Concerns contract** — The Concerns return section now requires flagging any non-obvious, load-bearing choice with a `Rejected alternatives:` sub-bullet naming what was considered and why it was rejected. This prevents the main session from "tidying" the implementer's code into a regression (motivated by a real incident where a misleading PHPDoc caused the caller to replace correct-but-unusual framework wiring with a more idiomatic approach that failed). The implementer also now treats caller-provided architectures (e.g. from `/feature-dev:feature-dev`) as hard constraints, surfacing deviations in Concerns rather than silently picking a different approach.
- **dev workflow: verify before overriding implementer choices** — `CLAUDE-APPEND.md` step 3 now instructs the main session to run the implementer's tests before overriding any non-obvious choice; if they pass, the choice should be treated as potentially load-bearing and traced before replacement. If no tests exist, trace before overriding.
- **dev workflow: `/dev-quality` vs `/simplify` clarification** — Step 4 now explains that `/dev-quality` is the end-of-task gate (it wraps `/simplify` plus test invocation); direct `/simplify` calls should be reserved for mid-task cleanup and post-`/batch` follow-up only. Consistent across `CLAUDE-APPEND.md`, `HOW-TO-USE.md`, and `README.md`.
- **dev workflow: optional planning gate via feature-dev** — A new optional step between Plan and Implement suggests running `/feature-dev:feature-dev` when the task touches unfamiliar code paths or framework internals (features, refactors, or bugfixes alike — trigger is unfamiliarity, not urgency). The chosen architecture should be recorded in the Task or Progress Log before invoking the implementer. Updated across `CLAUDE-APPEND.md`, `HOW-TO-USE.md`, `README.md`, and `RECOMMENDED-PLUGINS.md`.
- **dev-quality: code-review step removed** — `/simplify` already runs parallel reuse/quality/efficiency review agents on the changed files, so the follow-up `code-review:code-review` call was redundant overhead for the typical solo workflow. The pass is now tests → `/simplify` → tests. The `code-review` plugin remains an optional companion in `hatch` for PR review, security-sensitive code, and large refactors — invoke `/code-review` explicitly when the stakes warrant it.
- **hatch: no scheduled_checks entry for code-review** — since it is no longer part of any default code path, there is no reason to health-check it on a cadence. `docker.recommended_plugins` still records it when selected.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **Minimum core version bumped to v1.0.16** — dev-hermit now requires `claude-code-hermit` v1.0.16+ so that the `scheduled-checks` standalone routine (which runs dev-hermit's `scheduled_checks` entries) is guaranteed to be present in the project config.

---

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **BREAKING: minimum core version bumped to v1.0.15** — dev-hermit now requires `claude-code-hermit` v1.0.15+ to reflect the `scheduled_checks` rename and other protocol changes in the core.
- **hatch: `plugin_checks` → `scheduled_checks`** — All five references in the hatch skill updated to match core v1.0.15's renamed config key; `RECOMMENDED-PLUGINS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated likewise.
- **hatch: dev-cleanup routine gate removed** — The `< 1.0.12` version guard is redundant now that the min floor is v1.0.15; the cleanup routine question is shown unconditionally.
- **hatch report: surfaces `hermit-settings boot-skill`** — "Other core skills" block now includes the v1.0.14 boot-skill management command.
- **CLAUDE-APPEND: reflect suppression codes** — The reflect note now mentions structured Progress Log suppression codes (`no-evidence`, `weak-recurrence`, etc.) for tuning proposal tiers.
- **CLAUDE-APPEND: knowledge-schema.md pointer** — Dev Knowledge section points at `knowledge-schema.md` if present, matching core v1.0.15's new template.
- **release skill: `claude plugin validate` step** — Release flow now runs validation between file updates and commit, surfacing errors before they land in git.
- **marketplace.json: full metadata** — Added `author`, `license`, `homepage`, `repository`, and `keywords` fields to match core v1.0.15's expanded schema.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- **Skill renamed: `dev-hatch` → `hatch`** — The `dev-` prefix was redundant; the plugin namespace (`claude-code-dev-hermit:`) already conveys scope. Invoke as `/claude-code-dev-hermit:hatch`.

---

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **dev-hatch: weekly dev-cleanup routine** — Phase 3 wizard now offers an optional weekly branch cleanup routine (`0 10 * * 1`); requires hermit v1.0.12+. Routine is written to `config.json` and registered via `hermit-routines load` immediately.
- **dev-hatch report: `hermit-routines` entry** — "Other core skills" section now surfaces `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-routines` for managing the reflect routine and dev-cleanup.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE-APPEND: reflect phase note** — Step 6 (task boundary) now notes that reflect runs as a daily routine and that `newborn`-phase hermits (<3 days) produce fewer proposals — expected behaviour, not a gap.
- **CLAUDE-APPEND quick reference: `hermit-routines`** — Added entry with schedule details (reflect 9am daily, dev-cleanup weekly if enabled).

### Fixed

- **`plugin.json` invalid JSON** — Stray closing `}` removed.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Fully qualified agent/skill names enforced throughout skill instructions** — Bare names (`implementer`, `/dev-quality`, `code-review`) were replaced with canonical forms (`claude-code-dev-hermit:implementer`, `/claude-code-dev-hermit:dev-quality`, `code-review:code-review`) in all skill and template files. Mirrors the fix applied in claude-code-hermit v1.0.2.

### Files affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `state-templates/CLAUDE-APPEND.md` | `implementer` → `claude-code-dev-hermit:implementer` (table + workflow step + checklist) |
| `skills/dev-hatch/SKILL.md` | `implementer` → `claude-code-dev-hermit:implementer` (report output) |
| `skills/dev-quality/SKILL.md` | `code-review` → `code-review:code-review`; `implementer` → `claude-code-dev-hermit:implementer` |
