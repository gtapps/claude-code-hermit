# Changelog

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`proposal-triage` agent (Haiku)** — pre-creation gate for the proposal pipeline. Deduplicates against existing PROP-NNN files and applies the three-condition rule before any proposal is queued. Called by both `proposal-create` and `reflect` (Tier 1/2 micro-approvals). Returns `CREATE | SUPPRESS:<reason> | DUPLICATE:<id>`.
- **`reflection-judge` agent (Sonnet)** — post-reflect validator that verifies cross-session evidence citations actually exist in S-NNN-REPORT.md before proposals or micro-approvals are queued. Returns `ACCEPT | DOWNGRADE:<tier> | SUPPRESS` per candidate. Prevents phantom proposals from reflect runs with weak or fabricated evidence.
- **`knowledge` skill** — read-only lint of `raw/` and `compiled/`. Flags stale, unreferenced, missing-type, and oversized artifacts with actionable advice. Delegates to `scripts/knowledge-lint.js`. Activates on "check knowledge", "lint knowledge", "knowledge health".
- **`scripts/knowledge-lint.js`** — shared lint module extracted from `weekly-review.js`. Called by the `knowledge` skill and imported by the weekly review script. Eliminates the duplicate inline logic that previously lived only in the weekly review.
- **Test infrastructure: `tests/run-all.sh`, `tests/lib.sh`, `tests/run-scripts.sh`** — unified test entry point running hook, contract, and script suites in sequence. Script suite covers `knowledge-lint.js`, `check-upgrade.sh`, `deny-patterns.json`, bin executability, and knowledge lint scenarios. `lib.sh` provides shared assertions for shell test scripts.

### Changed

- **`reflect`: evidence validation pipeline** — before acting on any proposal candidate, `reflect` now delegates to `claude-code-hermit:reflection-judge` to verify that cited sessions actually describe the claimed pattern. Only ACCEPT and DOWNGRADE verdicts proceed. Additionally, all Tier 1/2 candidates pass through `claude-code-hermit:proposal-triage` before micro-approval queuing. Tier 3 candidates also pass through triage before calling `proposal-create`.
- **`proposal-create`: pre-creation gate** — calls `claude-code-hermit:proposal-triage` before writing any file. Stops with a caller-facing message on DUPLICATE or SUPPRESS. Eliminates redundant proposals without requiring the operator to review them.
- **`pulse --full`** — new flag that appends infrastructure health sections after the session block: proposal counts by status, pending micro-proposals, routines on/off, last reflect/heartbeat timestamps, and knowledge file counts (`raw/`, `compiled/`, `raw/.archive/`).
- **`heartbeat`: IDLE-TASKS management** — when the operator asks about idle tasks (add, remove, manage), heartbeat now reads/writes `.claude-code-hermit/IDLE-TASKS.md` instead of HEARTBEAT.md. Creates the file from template if absent. Warns if `idle_behavior` is not `"discover"`.
- **`weekly-review.js`: simplified via shared lint** — knowledge health section now calls `knowledgeLint()` from `knowledge-lint.js` instead of duplicating the logic inline. Output format updated to per-finding lines with file, age, and reason.
- **`HEARTBEAT.md.template`: removed two redundant built-in checks** — "Check for NEXT-TASK.md" and "Check if current task has blocked items that may have resolved" are handled natively by the heartbeat skill. Removed to reduce LLM reasoning load per tick.
- **Test runner unified** — `tests/run-hooks.sh` refactored to use shared lib. All suites now accessible via `bash tests/run-all.sh`. Smoke-test-runner agent updated to use the unified entry point.
- **`CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE-APPEND.md`** — `proposal-triage` and `reflection-judge` added to agent listings. `/knowledge` added to CLAUDE-APPEND.md Quick Reference. Subagent section in CLAUDE-APPEND.md expanded with descriptions for all four agents.

### Upgrade Instructions

Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-evolve`. The evolve skill handles:

1. **CLAUDE-APPEND refresh** — refresh CLAUDE-APPEND.md to pick up `/knowledge` in Quick Reference and the updated Subagents section (replaces the old single-line `## Subagent: session-mgr` entry).
2. **No config.json changes required** — all new behavior is in skill/agent files.
3. **New agents are available immediately** — `proposal-triage` and `reflection-judge` ship with the plugin; no per-project action needed. Skills that call them (`reflect`, `proposal-create`) will use them automatically.

**Clean up HEARTBEAT.md (if applicable):**

1. Read `.claude-code-hermit/HEARTBEAT.md`. If the file does not exist, skip these steps.
2. Remove the line `- Check for NEXT-TASK.md` if present. Remove the line `- Check if current task has blocked items that may have resolved` if present.
3. After both removals, for each of `## Idle Checks` and `## Task Checks`: if the header now has no remaining checklist items beneath it, remove that header too.
4. If any changes were made, write the file back and report what was cleaned up. If nothing changed, skip silently.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **Fully qualified agent/skill names enforced throughout skill instructions** — Bare names (e.g., `:session-mgr`) were silently misrouted by the harness. All skill instruction files now use the canonical `claude-code-hermit:<name>` form. Affects every skill that spawns a subagent or invokes another skill.
- **session-mgr: null `session_id` fallback on runtime.json write** — If `session_id` was null or missing when setting `session_state` to `in_progress`, the session would archive under `S-null`. Step 7 now pre-computes the ID in the same write if it wasn't set in step 6.
- **session-mgr: invocation payload takes precedence over stale SHELL.md** — On both close and idle-transition, if the caller passes structured task data (status, blockers, lessons, changed files), those values are used directly instead of re-reading potentially stale SHELL.md fields.

### Changed

- **session-start: fast-path gate skips session-mgr on normal startup** — When `runtime.json` is healthy (`session_state` ∈ {`in_progress`, `idle`, `waiting`}, no transition, no last_error) and SHELL.md exists, session-mgr is not spawned. SHELL.md content is already injected by the startup hook. This eliminates a full agent spawn on every normal session start.
- **session / session-close: compile final data in-context before handing off to session-mgr** — Callers now gather status, blockers, lessons, and changed files in-context and pass a compact structured payload to session-mgr. This removes the previous pattern where session-mgr had to re-read SHELL.md fields that the caller already knew, and prevents stale reads from overwriting in-context data.
- **session-mgr: maxTurns reduced from 15 to 12** — Consistent with actual observed turn counts; the previous ceiling was never reached.
- **hermit-settings: improved guidance** — Clearer instructions for configuring hermit behavior.

### Files affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/session-mgr.md` | maxTurns 15→12; null session_id fallback; payload-precedence rule on close/idle |
| `skills/session-start/SKILL.md` | Fast-path gate: skip session-mgr when runtime state is clean |
| `skills/session/SKILL.md` | Compile final data in-context; structured compact payload to session-mgr |
| `skills/session-close/SKILL.md` | Compile final data in-context; structured compact payload to session-mgr |
| `skills/hermit-settings/SKILL.md` | Improved configuration guidance |
| All skill/agent instruction files | Bare agent/skill names replaced with fully qualified `claude-code-hermit:` form |

### Upgrade Instructions

Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-evolve`. The evolve skill handles:

1. **CLAUDE-APPEND refresh** — No changes to CLAUDE-APPEND.md in this release; refresh is not required.
2. **No template changes** — State templates and `config.json` are unchanged.
3. **Behavioral changes are in skill/agent instruction files only** — These take effect immediately via the plugin; no per-project migration needed.

No `config.json` changes required.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- **State JSON files now copied from templates during hatch** — `alert-state.json`, `routine-queue.json`, and `micro-proposals.json` were previously created by the LLM writing inline JSON from memory. This could produce malformed content (e.g. `[]` instead of `{"queued": []}`) that silently broke routine queuing. They are now copied from canonical templates in `state-templates/`, matching the pattern used for all other hatch-created files.
- **Smoke-test now validates and repairs state file schema** — New step 6 checks all three schema-sensitive state files. If a file is missing, unparseable, or has the wrong shape, it is repaired (backfilling missing keys, overwriting wrong-type keys) without discarding existing data. Each repaired file emits a WARN.

### Added

- `state-templates/routine-queue.json.template` — canonical initial content `{"queued": []}`
- `state-templates/alert-state.json.template` — canonical initial content with `alerts`, `self_eval`, `total_ticks`, `last_digest_date`
- `state-templates/micro-proposals.json.template` — canonical initial content `{"active": null}`

### Files affected

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `state-templates/routine-queue.json.template` | New template |
| `state-templates/alert-state.json.template` | New template |
| `state-templates/micro-proposals.json.template` | New template |
| `skills/hatch/SKILL.md` | Copy 3 state files from templates instead of inline LLM JSON |
| `skills/smoke-test/SKILL.md` | Add step 6: state file validation and repair |

### Upgrade Instructions

Run `/claude-code-hermit:hermit-evolve`. The evolve skill handles:

1. **CLAUDE-APPEND refresh** — No changes to CLAUDE-APPEND.md in this release; refresh is not required.
2. **Template copy** — The three new `.template` files are only used during `hatch`. Existing hermit state files are not touched automatically; if you suspect a malformed state file, run `/claude-code-hermit:smoke-test` to detect and repair it.

No `config.json` changes required.
